## About Me

I'm Vikas Varma, a second-year BTech student at GRIET, Telangana. I'm not an expert yet — I'm still learning every day. This portfolio is part of my journey to improve my skills, document what I learn, and gradually build better and more useful websites.

I'm also interested in indie projects and love experimenting with small ideas that could turn into something big.
